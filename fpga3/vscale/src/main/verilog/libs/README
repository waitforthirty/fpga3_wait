----------------------------------------------- 

This directory contains Synopsys Design/Library Compiler's
technology and symbol libraries for vtvt_tsmc180.

** TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY **
Contains timing information and characterization of standard cells
Both ASCII and .DB files are provided
vtvt_tsmc180.lib and vtvt_tsmc180.db

** SYMBOL LIBRARY **
Contains symbol library files.
The libraries must be assigned to the "symbol_library" variable in 
the .synopsys_dc.setup file.

List of symbol libraries: 
	-basic.slib, basic.sdb, US.8ths.slib, US.8ths.sdb
		Cadence default basic library 
		Copied from $SYNOPSYS/doc/syn/interfaces/cadence/libraries/
		This symbol library package does not include Template Sheets. 
		US.8ths has been added for your convenience. 

	-NCSU_Analog_Parts.sdb: This file does not contain all of the original
		NCSU_Analog_Parts library cells. If one wish to add more symbols, this file
		needs to recompiled. Its data are located in the vtvt_tsmc180.slib file.

	-vtvt_tsmc180.slib and vtvt_tsmc180.sdb: Contains all the symbols information.
		Design Compiler does not read the 

** USAGE **
The files must all be included in the .synopsys_dc.setup file
in the Synopsys_Libraries directory in order to work with Synthesis.

** NOTE ** 
The ripper library is not included in this design.
